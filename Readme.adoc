== IAM-T1 Notes

The device notifies the sensor data at `ffe4` every minute by default.

Once "connected" (by writing `55aa0906010f` to `ffe9`), all device settings are notified at `ffe4`.
The reported settings are:

. Sampling Interval
. co2 limits
. Alarm mode
. Celsius/Fahrenheit

Writing `55aa0706000c` to `ffe9` leads to the whole co2 history being notified at `ffe4`.

There are 5 different models: IAM-T1, ..., IAM-T5, which should only differ in colour.
